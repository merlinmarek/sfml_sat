Implementation of the separating axis theorem for collision detection of convex objects (just rectangles at the moment).

This project depends on SFML and needs c++11 support.

Build with:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

Move with the mouse. Change the rectangle with tab and rotate by holding down the left mouse button.
